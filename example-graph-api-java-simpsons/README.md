This example uses the Java Graph API to build an ontology and load a simple dataset based on TV's "The Simpsons". It also illustrates  some simple queries on the data using the Java Graql API (which will be extended to a more complete example in due course). 

Further information about the example is available on the [GRAKN.AI blog](https://blog.grakn.ai/working-with-grakn-ai-using-java-5f13f24f1269).
