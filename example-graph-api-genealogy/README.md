## example-graph-api-genealogy

This example uses the Java Graph API to build an ontology and load data, plus some simple queries on the data using the Java Graql API (which will be extended to a more complete example in due course). Further information about the example is available in the [documentation](https://grakn.ai/pages/documentation/developing-with-java/graph-api.html).
